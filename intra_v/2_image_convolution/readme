1. function call.
2. output-driven: start with the output data, reversely analysis the data dependency. 
3. the advantage of using vector data types is that the code looks more compact. 
4. when meeting with constant number, we need pay attendtion to the type casting. 
5. sub-routine?? the same with the kernel
